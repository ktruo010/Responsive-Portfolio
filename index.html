            <p class="bodytext">Hello World, my name is Kevin. I was born and raised in California and I am extrmemely excited to share my work with you and to continue to develop my coding skills. These words have been written only after a few days of class but I think that I have grasped a good understanding of how CSS Grids work. When I am not in class, I am either working or I am at home eating, sleeping, or playing with my cat. My cat's name is Pepper and he is an Egyptian Mau. I am very proud to have been able to train him to use the toilet. No cat litter for me! Other things I like to do include cooking, watching movies, and hanging out with friends. The thing about cooking that I hate the most is cleaning the dishes. Up until about a year ago, I was not able to make the dishwasher work and I could not figure out why. I turned it on but for some reason, the water did not drain correctly... For the longest time, this was a huge frustration. Then I figured out that when you attach a dishwasher the garbage disposal, you need to punchure the hole in the garbage disposal! My life has been a breeze since.</p>
